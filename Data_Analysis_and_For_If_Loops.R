# Diff analyses 
  # Experimental Designs
    #  independent versus dependent variables
    #  discrete versus continuous variables (range of numbers is cont, discrete is categorical)
      # cont on both axes is regression via scatterplot 
      # x is cat y is cont is t-test/standard ANOVA via box plot or bar graph 
      # cat on both axes is chi-squared via table, mosaic
      # x is cont y is cat is logistic regression via logistic curve 
    #  continuous variables (integer and real)
    #  direction of cause and effect, x axis is independent
    #  continuous versus discrete (natural or arbitrary or statistical bins)
